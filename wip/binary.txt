a = ride a bike = 0 for no, 1 for yes
b = eat a burger = 0 for no, 1 for yes

what is the value of a AND b when

you ride a bike and eat a burger: 1 AND 1 = 1
you don't ride a bike and eat a burger: 0 AND 1 = 0
you don't ride a bike and don't eat a burger: 0 AND 0 = 0
you ride a bike and don't eat a burger: 1 AND 0 = 0 







you ride a bike or eat a burger: 1 OR 1 = 1
you don't ride a bike or eat a burger: 
you don't ride a bike or don't eat a burger:
you ride a bike or don't eat a burger: 











you either ride a bike or eat a burger: 1 XOR 1 = 0
you either don't ride a bike or eat a burger: 0 XOR 1 = 1
you either don't ride a bike or don't eat a burger: 0 XOR 0 = 0
you either ride a bike or don't eat a burger: 1 XOR 0 = 1
