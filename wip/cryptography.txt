caesar shift

plaintext: 	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ciphertext: 	defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc

encryption: go from plaintext to ciphertext
decryption: go from ciphertext to plaintext

encrypt: find letter in plaintext alphabet and go straight down to ciphertext alphabet

decrypt: find letter in ciphertext alphabet and go straight up to plaintext alphabet

encrypt "this is a message"
decrypt "d vhfuhw phvvdjh"
vigenere with key

	
plaintext alphabet:	abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ciphertext alphabet:	bacondefghijklmpqrstuvwxyz
ciphertext cab alpha:	cabdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

encrypt "this is a bacony message" as a vigenere with key "bacon"
ciphertext bacon key: tfgs gs b abcmly knssben
ciphertext cab key: this is c acbony messcge

plaintext bacon with cab key: 


encrypt "go to the store" with key "jumbo"
plaintext: 		abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ciphertext jumbo:	jumboacdefghiklnpqrstvwxyz




problem: encrypt as a caesar shift: this is a very long message that has a lot of letters and words that would take a very long time to encrypt and decrypt.
